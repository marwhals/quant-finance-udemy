# My Project

This project demonstrates the application of mathematical models.

## Introduction

In this project, we will be discussing the famous equation from **Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity**:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

Where:
- \( E \) is energy,
- \( m \) is mass,
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

This equation demonstrates the relationship between mass and energy.

## More Complex Theory

We also discuss the **Integral of Gaussian Function**, which has significant applications in statistics and probability theory:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

This equation shows the result of integrating the Gaussian function over all real numbers, which is a key concept in many areas of science.

## Example: Using the Gaussian Function

For a standard normal distribution, we use the following equation to calculate the probability density function:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}
$$

This equation is essential in **statistical modeling** and **machine learning algorithms**.
